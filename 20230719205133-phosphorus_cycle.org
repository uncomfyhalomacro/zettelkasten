#+title: Phosphorus Cycle

Phosphorus is needed for the formation of nucleic acids such as the phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA. It's
required to most life processes.

Phosphorus is locked away in rocks and ocean sediment and enters the ecosystem through the process called
_weathering_ or _erosion_.
