#+title: Nutrient Cycle

The nutrient cycle comprises of how essential compounds and elements are cycled in the ecosystem. They are
also called as /*biogeochemical cycles*/.

The materials cycle through both *biotic* and *abiotic reservoirs*.

These includes the following:
- [[id:8f028610-6d41-4103-a0b3-10e4234abc3a][Carbon Cycle]]
- [[id:2fdf710c-3e4c-486b-8e0c-c6b060e76496][Nitrogen Cycle]]
- [[id:4454c09a-bed0-430b-8273-87a67d7c15fc][Phosphorus Cycle]]
- [[id:86dd0d8d-fd13-42e1-9214-de014bfc3ed8][Water Cycle]]

These nutrients are sometimes called *Limiting Factors* or *Limiting Nutrient*. The amount of nutrients
present in an ecosystem can affect living conditions of the environment. Less nutrient may decrease
overall productivity. Additional nutrient may increase productivity.

However, an additional increase of nutrient may harm the environment such as the process called [[id:1e8fdbc8-37a5-498b-83d5-cdd1c73d0cf3][Eutrophication]].
