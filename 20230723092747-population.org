#+title: Population

In [[id:87a7d2cb-6510-4376-99f3-0dbff8e5d542][Ecology]] and [[id:1971c450-d156-4e1e-8310-911e12f06370][Population Dynamics]], a _population_ describes /the number of species within a particular area or region at a particular time/.

There are many /parameters/ of population, namely, population density, birth rate, death rate, age structure,
fecundity and population size.

* Population Size
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       686a494d-81a9-4eba-95f8-6ad4918b3fdf
:END:

The number of individuals present in a subjectively designated geographic range.

** Factors affecting [[id:686a494d-81a9-4eba-95f8-6ad4918b3fdf][Population Size]]

- Immigration and births increases population size.
- Emigration and deaths decreases population size

Population size is estimated rather than using raw numbers based on total number of births or deaths
per 1,000 people in a population.

* Population Density
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3cf0bba6-e4d7-49ff-9609-afc48c6889b5
:END:

The size of a population in relation to the amount of space that it occupies.

* Age Structures
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ad507c29-9c4c-4efe-b288-1c065a727d50
:END:

How fast a population grows or declines is based on its age structure.

- _Preproductive age_: not mature enough to reproduce.
- _Reproductive age_: those capable of reproduction.
- _Postreproductive age_: those too old to reproduce.
