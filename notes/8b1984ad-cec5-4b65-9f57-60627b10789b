This is what we refer as _nitrogen-fixation_. This refers to the process where nitrogen is converted
into soluble nitrites (NO_{2}) and nitrates (NO_{3}).

Lightning nitrogen-fixation requires lightning to "fix" nitrogen into nitrites and nitrates.

Microbial nitrogen-fixation converts ammonia and ammonium into nitrites and nitrates.
