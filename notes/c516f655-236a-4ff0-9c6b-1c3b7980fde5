Ecological Niche describes an organism's way of life in its environment. This is dictated by various
environmental factors and evolutionary pressures.

#+begin_quote
A species' niche is all of the environment factors and interspecies relationships that influence the species.

Species are assigned from their environment for what roles they have. These assignments are either specialists
and generalists; the former is a result of narrow and limited niches and the latter is a result of broader
niches.

Niches are also subdivided based on factors that may affect an organism's survival.

** Fundamental Niche

This describes the entire set of conditions under which an organism can survive and reproduce itself

** Realized Niche

This describe the sets of conditions that are actually used by an organism after interactions with other
species.

#+begin_quote
To avoid confusion, the fundamental niches is the environment and its parts. The realized niche is organisms
interacting with other organisms and how it affects their roles in that environment.
