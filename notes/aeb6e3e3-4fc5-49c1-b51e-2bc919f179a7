** Commensalism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       71c39a81-8de0-4c79-a7da-1e6a7c3c1dbf
:END:

Commensalism is an interaction between two organisms whereas one benefits from the other while the other organism is unharmed.

** Mutualism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d5864032-24e1-446c-9fb8-91a217ab74b7
:END:

Mutualism is an interaction between two organisms whereas both organisms benefit from their interactions e.g.
sea anemone and clownfish (one protects while the other gives food).

** Parasitism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e4485920-c207-43c2-aa6c-2bdc8705a54b
:END:

Parasitism is an interaction between two organisms: the parasite and the host.

The parasite takes the resources from the host organism and may harm the host organism in the process. Parasites
are either ectoparasitic (external) or endoparasitic (internal).

** Symbiosis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2f4e721f-b827-4a7d-aa3f-822bf36d66e3
:END:

Similar to [[id:d5864032-24e1-446c-9fb8-91a217ab74b7][Mutualism]]. However, one must exist for the other, otherwise, the organism involved will die. An
example of symbiotic relationships are *lichens*.

** Predation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       042aaeea-a117-4cff-a440-5c3dbd48b613
:END:

This is an interaction between organisms where there is an organism to be eaten (prey), and the other that eats
(predator).
