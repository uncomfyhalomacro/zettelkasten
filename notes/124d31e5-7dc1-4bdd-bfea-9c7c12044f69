It is a measure of the demands made by a person or a group of people on global natural resources.

See [[id:044d82e3-8f4e-44e3-90f7-cce0ecb026f2][Carrying Capacity]].

This is defined as */the maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained
by the environment/*. The carrying capacity is an *inverse of the [[id:7c5dd2ad-71b7-4082-927b-fa32d02d421d][Ecological Footprint]]*. This means,
a growing population that takes resources (the footprint) will one day exhaust or reach the maximum
carrying capacity.
