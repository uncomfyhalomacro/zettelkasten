#+title: Environmental Science

Environmental Science is an /interdisciplinary field/ that tackles various angles such as
the importance of the environment, and the impacts of human activity and how social problems
are related to environmental issues. These also includes topics such as [[id:72c49662-3a01-47a4-8d28-86058e743c73][Global Warming]], [[id:083d72c4-1273-4562-98e4-b72ffb93402c][Climate Change]],
and [[id:518f0cc2-c05b-4e6e-97d2-ee56038f0168][biodiversity]].

Environmental Science can be thought of a mix of both social sciences and natural sciences; the former
dealing with human activity and human behavior, and the latter dealing with biogeochemical processes
such as predator and prey relationships, and the [[id:62e74b2d-f1fb-4c81-82e9-e5974ea82c6e][Nutrient Cycle]] e.g. [[id:8f028610-6d41-4103-a0b3-10e4234abc3a][Carbon Cycle]], [[id:2fdf710c-3e4c-486b-8e0c-c6b060e76496][Nitrogen Cycle]], [[id:4454c09a-bed0-430b-8273-87a67d7c15fc][Phosphorus Cycle]], [[id:86dd0d8d-fd13-42e1-9214-de014bfc3ed8][Water Cycle]], and [[id:1e8fdbc8-37a5-498b-83d5-cdd1c73d0cf3][Eutrophication]] â€” which is the overall subject can be considered under [[id:87a7d2cb-6510-4376-99f3-0dbff8e5d542][Ecology]].

Environmental Science should not be confused with [[id:9cb79d55-7495-4457-a11e-872bda8ff6c2][Environmentalism]] as the former focused on science
and the latter focuses on */advocacy/*.

It is a measure of the demands made by a person or a group of people on global natural resources.

See [[id:044d82e3-8f4e-44e3-90f7-cce0ecb026f2][Carrying Capacity]].

** Carrying Capacity

This is defined as */the maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained
by the environment/*. The carrying capacity is an *inverse of the [[id:7c5dd2ad-71b7-4082-927b-fa32d02d421d][Ecological Footprint]]*. This means,
a growing population that takes resources (the footprint) will one day exhaust or reach the maximum
carrying capacity.
