#+title: Eutrophication

This is the process that describes that introducing additional nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus
to bodies of water can allow species of algae to grow out of control. Once the nutrient is depleted, this increase of algae growth will die off and decay which _depletes_ the /oxygen level/ dissolved in the water.

This creates */_dead zones_/*, where areas of water bodies do not have enough oxygen to support some species.
