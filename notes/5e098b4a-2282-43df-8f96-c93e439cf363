Ecosystems and habitats are sometimes interchangeable.

#+begin_quote
Habitats refer to different levels composition of functional units of various organisms and abiotic components such as humidity, and may be terrestrial or aquatic. Ecosystems, however, can encompass from the microscopic level to the entirety of the biosphere. A habitat is, therefore, just another name for a small part of an ecosystem.

To understand what this means, the whole planet can be considered an ecosystem as a whole. A pile of rotten logs is also an ecosystem. Habitats are just subjective terms to identify various differences in geographical components just like how we name things in general.

Organisms may require certain things to survive in the environment
- Shelter
- Food
- Light
- Growth medium
- Water

Most of these are provided by the habitats they are in. It also depends on what kind of organism. Some organisms
do not require much water or light such as other microbial species.
