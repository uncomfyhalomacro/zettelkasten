Carbon is also stored through the process of sequestrative processes such as photosynthesis and
geological processes where carbon dioxide is trapped between rocks either as dissolved CO_{2} in water
or air pockets within rock crevices. *Fossilization* and *Coal formation* is another sequestrative process
where it stores carbon from dead organisms such as plants and animals and is stored undergound through heat
and pressure, and sedimentation. This reservoirs of carbon are also called *carbon sinks*.
