#+title: Carbon Cycle

The element *carbon* is the backbone of all organic compounds used for the synthesis of important molecules such
as _proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids_.

Carbon exists as *carbon dioxide* in the atmosphere and must be converted into usable form. Plants do this
through the process called */photosynthesis/* which converts CO_{2} to *glucose*.

Other processes are involved in the [[id:8f028610-6d41-4103-a0b3-10e4234abc3a][Carbon Cycle]]:

* Cellular Respiration

:END:

Cellular Respiration is the process of which glucose is broken down to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
to be used as energy. The process requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide and water as *waste*. This
results of returning *carbon* back to the atmosphere as CO_{2}.


* Decomposition
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       30d5d68e-bc64-41d3-bfc0-7d77270d8acf
:END:

Dead material and organic matter are broken down by *decomposers* from complex to simpler compounds, thus,
returning carbon to the environment.

* Combustion
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       aed8ef2b-7a2a-4ee3-92ce-0266a6b6470f
:END:

Burning such as those from wildfires and from fossil fuels from human activity also returns carbon as CO_{2}
gas back to the atmosphere. Incomplete combustion is released as carbon monoxide.

* Dissolution
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       035a930f-bce6-47a7-8005-6b58bc071ba1
:END:

It's the dissolving of gas to a liquid. This happens to atmospheric CO_{2} as well where it also dissolves on
bodies of liquid water.
