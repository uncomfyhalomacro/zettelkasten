Energy is the whole driving force for everything that is happening in or on the planet.
Life requires energy to do various functions where the end goal is to reproduce and to sustain a stable
population.

Energy flows through the ecosystem from high density energy organic matter such as carbohydrates produced from
*photosynthesis*, to low density energy organic matter from *heterotrophs* e.g. primary consumers, herbivores.

The reason why it goes from *high* to *low* is because using energy is /inefficient/ and is lost as _*heat*_.

Each "level" of energy from high to low is called the _*trophic level*_.

Simplified models of how energy flows in the ecosystem are presented as energy pyramids, food/energy chain, and the food web. All of these models contain the same or similar components in the following:

- Producers; where composed of autotrophic organisms such as plants.
- Consumers; where these can be further broken down as
  - Primary consumers
  - Secondary consumers
  - Tertiary consumers
- Decomposers; mostly comprised of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria which breakdown dead matter into simpler compounds.

Here are some image examples:

** Flaws in this kind of models

#+begin_quote
Unfortunately, these models do not really explain much of how the ecosystems actually work. For example, where
can we assign organisms that generate energy from inorganic sources such as sulfur and methane and not directly
from the Sun? These models fail to actually account for anything beyond photosynthesis, herbivory, carnivory,
and omnivory.
