#+title: Limits on Population Growth

In [[id:1971c450-d156-4e1e-8310-911e12f06370][Population Dynamics]], /no population can increase its size indefinitely/.
- The /intrinsic rate of increase/ (/*r*/) is the rate at whcih a population would grow
  if it had unlimited resources.
- [[id:044d82e3-8f4e-44e3-90f7-cce0ecb026f2][Carrying Capacity]] (/*K*/) describes the maximum population of a given species that
  a particular habitat can sustain indefinitely without degrading the habitat
  
Further explanations about factors that affect population growth are in [[id:1c4cf927-6b6c-46b0-bd08-d4e08d5415c7][Behaviors in Population Growth]].
