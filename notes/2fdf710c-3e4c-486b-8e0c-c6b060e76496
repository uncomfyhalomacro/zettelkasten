#+title: Nitrogen Cycle

This cycle describes the movement of nitrogen between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and
the geosphere. _Gaseous nitrogen (N_{2}) is useless on its own_. Fortunately, natural processes
such as lightning strikes */fixes/* nitrogen to usable forms such as _nitrates_, and _nitrites_. Other
organisms, such as legumes, have species of bacteria and fungi on their root nodes that /*fixes*/
nitrogen into usable form. This process is called _*nitrogen-fixation*_.
