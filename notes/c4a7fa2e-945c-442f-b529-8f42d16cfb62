This note is for my test drive of [[id:65f323d7-9580-4e98-ba6b-edc2d1ed8a7f][Programming Languages]]


I learned Crystal from the *Crystal Programming Book* authored by George Dietrich and
Guilherme Bernal (with other contributors).

* Brief History

- Crystal was created in 2011
- Manas Technology Solutions created the language (https://manas.tech)
- Authors
  - Ary Borenszweig
  - Brian Cardiff
  - Juan Wajnerman
- Has over 500 Contributors and growing
- Production Ready
- Source code is found at https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal

** Features

- Static Typing
- Ruby-esque syntax
- Compiles into machine code
- Leverages LLVM
- Expressive as Ruby
- Concurrency
- Low-level; can call C libraries or assembly
- Project Manager called Shards. It's similar to [[id:ac5483d3-ad5a-4256-a4a5-9c8a2bdf86a3][Rust]]'s [[id:db41dc33-a11e-4c07-9ad0-25ee125fa49e][Cargo]]
- Multi-dispatch like [[id:012ea94d-2074-4147-a72a-94efb4b38ed4][Julia]] (There maybe some differences that I don't know)
