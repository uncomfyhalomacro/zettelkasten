#+title: Ecology

Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their physical environment. The living organisms and their by-products are called as the [[id:2640469d-dbbe-448d-8751-cc46dbd8fea9][biotic components]] and the physical environment such as water, air, and soil, are called as [[id:0af132a6-445e-4b1f-95e6-b89b861ab5d6][abiotic Components]]. These constitutes to what we call as an *ecosystem*, a collection and interaction between abiotic and biotic components.

* Abiotic Components

:ID:       0af132a6-445e-4b1f-95e6-b89b861ab5d6
:END:

Abiotic components include the following environmental factors such as

- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level of soil
- Weather
- Climate
- Altitude

* Biotic Components

These includes all living things in an ecosystem. These includes
- Plants
- Animals
- Fungi
- and other microorganisms

Energy is the whole driving force for everything that is happening in or on the planet.
Life requires energy to do various functions where the end goal is to reproduce and to sustain a stable
population.

Energy flows through the ecosystem from high density energy organic matter such as carbohydrates produced from
*photosynthesis*, to low density energy organic matter from *heterotrophs* e.g. primary consumers, herbivores.

The reason why it goes from *high* to *low* is because using energy is /inefficient/ and is lost as _*heat*_.

Each "level" of energy from high to low is called the _*trophic level*_.

Simplified models of how energy flows in the ecosystem are presented as energy pyramids, food/energy chain, and the food web. All of these models contain the same or similar components in the following:

- Producers; where composed of autotrophic organisms such as plants.
- Consumers; where these can be further broken down as
  - Primary consumers
  - Secondary consumers
  - Tertiary consumers
- Decomposers; mostly comprised of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria which breakdown dead matter into simpler compounds.

Here are some image examples:
