#+title: Ecology

Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their physical environment. The term was
first described by _Ernst Haeckel_.

#+begin_quote
oekologie [refers] to the “relation of the animal both to its organic as well as its inorganic environment.”
#+end_quote

The living organisms and their by-products are called as the [[id:2640469d-dbbe-448d-8751-cc46dbd8fea9][biotic components]] and the physical environment such as water, air, and soil, are called as [[id:0af132a6-445e-4b1f-95e6-b89b861ab5d6][abiotic components]]. These constitutes to what we call as an *ecosystem*, a collection and interaction between abiotic and biotic components.

* Abiotic Components
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0af132a6-445e-4b1f-95e6-b89b861ab5d6
:END:

Abiotic components include the following environmental factors such as

- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level of soil
- Weather
- Climate
- Altitude

* Biotic Components
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2640469d-dbbe-448d-8751-cc46dbd8fea9
:END:

These includes all living things in an ecosystem. These includes
- Plants
- Animals
- Fungi
- and other microorganisms

* Energy Flows
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       94dea82f-2fa6-42d9-988f-d486e0e74f72
:END:

Energy is the whole driving force for everything that is happening in or on the planet.
Life requires energy to do various functions where the end goal is to reproduce and to sustain a stable
population.

Energy flows through the ecosystem from high density energy organic matter such as carbohydrates produced from
*photosynthesis*, to low density energy organic matter from *heterotrophs* e.g. primary consumers, herbivores.

The reason why it goes from *high* to *low* is because using energy is /inefficient/ and is lost as _*heat*_.

Each "level" of energy from high to low is called the _*trophic level*_.

Simplified models of how energy flows in the ecosystem are presented as energy pyramids, food/energy chain, and the food web. All of these models contain the same or similar components in the following:

- Producers; where composed of autotrophic organisms such as plants.
- Consumers; where these can be further broken down as
  - Primary consumers
  - Secondary consumers
  - Tertiary consumers
- Decomposers; mostly comprised of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria which breakdown dead matter into simpler compounds.

Here are some image examples:

** Flaws in this kind of models

#+begin_quote
Unfortunately, these models do not really explain much of how the ecosystems actually work. For example, where
can we assign organisms that generate energy from inorganic sources such as sulfur and methane and not directly
from the Sun? These models fail to actually account for anything beyond photosynthesis, herbivory, carnivory,
and omnivory.

* Organism Interactions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       aeb6e3e3-4fc5-49c1-b51e-2bc919f179a7
:END:

** Commensalism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       71c39a81-8de0-4c79-a7da-1e6a7c3c1dbf
:END:

Commensalism is an interaction between two organisms whereas one benefits from the other while the other organism is unharmed.

** Mutualism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d5864032-24e1-446c-9fb8-91a217ab74b7
:END:

Mutualism is an interaction between two organisms whereas both organisms benefit from their interactions e.g.
sea anemone and clownfish (one protects while the other gives food).

** Parasitism
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e4485920-c207-43c2-aa6c-2bdc8705a54b
:END:

Parasitism is an interaction between two organisms: the parasite and the host.

The parasite takes the resources from the host organism and may harm the host organism in the process. Parasites
are either ectoparasitic (external) or endoparasitic (internal).

** Symbiosis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2f4e721f-b827-4a7d-aa3f-822bf36d66e3
:END:

Similar to [[id:d5864032-24e1-446c-9fb8-91a217ab74b7][Mutualism]]. However, one must exist for the other, otherwise, the organism involved will die. An
example of symbiotic relationships are *lichens*.

** Predation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       042aaeea-a117-4cff-a440-5c3dbd48b613
:END:

This is an interaction between organisms where there is an organism to be eaten (prey), and the other that eats
(predator).

#+begin_quote
A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an
organism needs to survive.
#+end_quote

Ecosystems and habitats are sometimes interchangeable.

#+begin_quote
Habitats refer to different levels composition of functional units of various organisms and abiotic components such as humidity, and may be terrestrial or aquatic. Ecosystems, however, can encompass from the microscopic level to the entirety of the biosphere. A habitat is, therefore, just another name for a small part of an ecosystem.

To understand what this means, the whole planet can be considered an ecosystem as a whole. A pile of rotten logs is also an ecosystem. Habitats are just subjective terms to identify various differences in geographical components just like how we name things in general.
#+end_quote

Organisms may require certain things to survive in the environment
- Shelter
- Food
- Light
- Growth medium
- Water

Most of these are provided by the habitats they are in. It also depends on what kind of organism. Some organisms
do not require much water or light such as other microbial species.

* Ecological Niche
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c516f655-236a-4ff0-9c6b-1c3b7980fde5
:END:

Ecological Niche describes an organism's way of life in its environment. This is dictated by various
environmental factors and evolutionary pressures.

#+begin_quote
A species' niche is all of the environment factors and interspecies relationships that influence the species.
#+end_quote

Species are assigned from their environment for what roles they have. These assignments are either specialists
and generalists; the former is a result of narrow and limited niches and the latter is a result of broader
niches.

Niches are also subdivided based on factors that may affect an organism's survival.

** Fundamental Niche

This describes the entire set of conditions under which an organism can survive and reproduce itself

** Realized Niche

This describe the sets of conditions that are actually used by an organism after interactions with other
species.

#+begin_quote
To avoid confusion, the fundamental niches is the environment and its parts. The realized niche is organisms
interacting with other organisms and how it affects their roles in that environment.
